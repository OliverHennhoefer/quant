\details{
Dividend per share (DPS) is the sum of declared dividends issued by a company
for every ordinary share outstanding. The figure is calculated by dividing
the total dividends paid out by a business, including interim dividends, over
a period of time, usually a year, by the number of outstanding ordinary
shares issued.
