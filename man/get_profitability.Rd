\details{
Gurufocus.com calculated the Profitability Rank by how profitable a company
is and how likely the company's business will stay that way. The maximum rank
is 10. A rank of 7 or higher means a higher profitability and may stay that
way. A rank of 3 or lower indicates that the company has had trouble to make
a profit.
The Profitability Rank is based on the Operating Margin and its 5-year
average, the Piotroski F-Score, the Consistency of the Profitability and the
Predictability Rank (see get_predictability)
